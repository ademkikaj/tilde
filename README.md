# TILDE: top-down induction of first-order logical  decision trees #

This repository contains an implementation of the TILDE algorithm. The implementation is in function of my master thesis in Artificial Intelligence. An explanation of TILDE can be found in:
> Blockeel, H., & De Raedt, L. (1998). Top-down induction of first-order logical decision trees. Artificial Intelligence, 101(1�2), 285�297. http://doi.org/10.1016/S0004-3702(98)00034-4

The *mai_version* package contains the version made for a master thesis. 

The *refactor* package contains a rework, which tries to reduce the dependency on ProbLog for query and example representations.
It contains its own README.md file introducing the package's content.


### How do I get set up? ###
Pyhon 3.6 is required, since the typing module is used.


### Example data sets

A couple of toy example data sets to get started with can be found in [the ACE documentation](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/ACE/doc/).
